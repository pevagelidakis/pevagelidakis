- 🔭 I’m currently working on studying for my master on Data Analysis and Machine Statistical Learning. In my free time, I am trying to build a quiz that changes dynamically based on user's preference. I 'm also trying to combine that with automated machine learning methods, such that the user can have a better experience. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  Mathematical and Computational Statistics and Machine Learning decaying them regarding their math perspective. I'm also eager to learn about Angular and Typescript and try to work on back-end procedure, after the User Data have been received.
